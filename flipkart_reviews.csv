realme 108 cm (43 inch) Ultra HD (4K) LED Smart Android TV with Handsfree Voice Search and Dolby Vision & Atmos  (RMV2004),The TV doesn't even Support Widevine DRM security Level: L1 which all streaming apps require for playing 4k content. So it's 4k quality is just for show since we can't even use it. Disney+hotstar doesn't let me play 4k content because TV support DRM L3 which unprotected instead of L1. So no 4k content. 1080P tv is better than this mess. All you can do with this 4k TV is play YouTube in 4k. No other paying streaming app. Very disappointed.,1

Fast (2GB Ram), have good internal memory at 16GB.3. Happy with the sound quality, it gets loud if you have right audio settings. ( Refer Tech Singh YouTube video)4. Tv display is bit flimsy while holding the tv for mounting, but it may be because it is large at 55 Inch.5. I sit 8 feet away from my tv and it feels large, like a theatre in here, not sure if that is a good thing for eyes, let's wait and see....",4
